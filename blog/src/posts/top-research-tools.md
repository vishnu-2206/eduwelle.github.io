Conducting research as a student is tough — but with the right tools, it becomes a lot easier. Here are 5 must-have tools:

1. **Zotero** – Reference manager
2. **Overleaf** – Collaborative LaTeX editing
3. **JASP** – Free statistical analysis
4. **Scite** – Smarter citation tracking
5. **ChatGPT + EduWelle prompts** – For brainstorming and writing clarity

We teach students to integrate these tools effectively in our mentorship programs. Want a full tutorial? Let us know in the comments!
