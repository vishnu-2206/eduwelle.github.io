Starting an AI project doesn’t need to be intimidating. Here's a simple roadmap:

1. **Define the Problem** – e.g., classification, prediction, clustering
2. **Collect & Clean Data** – Use public datasets or EduWelle-curated sources
3. **Choose a Model** – Start with `scikit-learn`, then explore `TensorFlow`
4. **Train and Evaluate** – Split your data, test accuracy
5. **Visualize and Deploy** – Create plots, and optionally deploy with Streamlit
